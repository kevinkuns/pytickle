# QLANCE Examples

1. The Fabry Perot examples demonstrate the basic QLANCE usage with separate Optickle and Finesse notebooks doing the same calculations.
2. The Fabry Perot Michelson interferometer (FPMI) notebooks give a detailed example of a MIMO control loop in separate Optickle and Finesse notebooks.
3. The 40m and Sagnac examples are less well commented Optickle-only examples
